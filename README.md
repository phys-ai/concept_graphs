# Compositional Abilities Emerge Multiplicatively: Exploring Diffusion Models on a Synthetic Task 

## Introduction
This project is the codebase for the paper titled "Compositional Abilities Emerge Multiplicatively: Exploring Diffusion Models on a Synthetic Task," presented at NeurIPS 2023. The code implements Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and is built using PyTorch.

## Usage
First, create an `input` directory at the root level of this project. Then, place the data files under the `input` directory.

To train the model with the synthetic data, run the `train.py` script with the desired parameters. For example:

`python3 train.py --dataset single-body_2d_3classes`

To train the model using the CelebA dataset:

`python3 train.py --dataset celeba-3classes-10000`


## Structure
- `train.py`: Main script for training the DDPM model.
- `load_dataset.py`: Script for loading and processing datasets.


## References
- The `DDPM` class in `train.py` is based on the implementation found at [TeaPearce/Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST](https://github.com/TeaPearce/Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST/blob/main/script.py).
- The `CrossAttention` class in `train.py` is inspired by the code in [Animadversio/DiffusionFromScratch/StableDiff_UNet_model.py](https://github.com/Animadversio/DiffusionFromScratch/blob/master/StableDiff_UNet_model.py).
